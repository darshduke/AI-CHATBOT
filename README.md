# AI-Based Chatbot
This is an AI-based chatbot application that uses natural language processing and machine learning techniques to interact with users in a conversational manner. It is built using JavaScript, MongoDB, and an AI-based tool or OpenAI API for natural language understanding. The chatbot is designed to handle multiple intents and entities, store and retrieve data from a MongoDB database, and provide a personalized user experience.
# Features
Support for multiple intents and entities, allowing the chatbot to understand a wide range of user inputs and respond appropriately.
Integration with an AI-based tool or OpenAI API for natural language understanding, enabling the chatbot to analyze user messages and identify their intent and any relevant entities.
Use of MongoDB as the primary data store, allowing the chatbot to store and retrieve user data and conversation history.
Personalized user experience, where the chatbot can use stored data to provide a customized experience to users.
